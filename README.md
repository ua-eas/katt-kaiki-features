Kaiki Features
===================


Introduction
------------

This is the repository that holds all of the Cucumber feature files for UofA.

* As of Nov. 25th, 2013 it contains features 1-14 for Kuali Coeus and
  feature PA004 for Kuali Financial System.


Rakefile Requirements
---------------------

Each feature file will need to have a tag name appended to the top of the file.
This tag name is more useful if it refers to the specific test itself.
