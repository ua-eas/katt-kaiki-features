Kaiki Features
===================


Introduction
------------

This is the repository that holds all of the Cucumber feature files for UofA.

* As of 9 Oct, 2013, only feature files for the Kuali Coeus system are housed here.


Rakefile Requirements
---------------------

Each feature file will need to have a tag name appended to the top of the file. This tag name can either refer to the
feature file itself, if the tests need to be run in a certain order, or can be "@kctest" if it doesn't matter when
the test is run.
